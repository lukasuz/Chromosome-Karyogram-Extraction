# Karyogramm-Extraction

A script to extract chromosome pairs from karyograms. Currently it is limited to extracting only a healthy set of chromosomes, i.e. 23 pairs. Still work in progress.



**TODO:**

- Add option to extract single chromosomes instead of pairs
- Function for extracting all chromosomes from a folder
- Save images where multiple chromosomes or writing was detected so the user can manually remove those
- Add example in README
